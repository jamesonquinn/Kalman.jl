filtertest4.csv: using exp(-lp) INCONSISTENTLY in probSum, nIter = [1, 5, 20, 400]. No obvious trend in divergence over nIter; if anything, getting better.

filtertest5.csv: using exp(lp). Worse than filtertest4.

filtertest6.csv: using exp(-lp) consistently. Seems that it's right — the trace part of the divergence has a clear downward trend, yay. But — the diff-in-means part of the divergence has an upward trend. I think it's because I have not corrected for the forward density? I will try fixing that.


filtertest9.csv: bigger numbers of particles.

10: even more particles, but just for finkel.

11: like 10, ... forgot to make fps global. oh well.

12: global fps...
julia> print([cor(wmean,bkf.params(finalDist)[1]),
       cor(vec(mean(fps[end].tip.particles,2)),bkf.params(finalDist)[1]),
       cor(wmean,vec(mean(fps[end].tip.particles,2))),
       cor(wmean,observations[end].y),
       cor(observations[end].y,bkf.params(finalDist)[1])
       ])
[0.85266, 0.863401, 0.999003, 0.91942, 0.791686]

13: removing forwardProb correction. Better!

14: mega sim — but no timing. BROKEN! measures divegence from final step, not from current step.

15: mega sim 2. 2 histPerLoc.

16: vary histPerLoc. uniform history sampling

17: as above, with MhSampLog(7.5,20.0)

NOOOOO! 15-17 were as broken as 14. Fixed.

18: like 17 but works???

19: now with timing. But finkel fails — try/catch issue?

20: several abortive runs trying to fix try/catch.

21: fixed??

22: compromise?

23: more compromise, with lower histPerLoc (to make up for more locs)

24: mhcompromise with sampleuniform

25: mhsampled, SampleUniform; with higher particles for non-finkel

26: as above, measuring squared error

27: as above, varying mh and sample

28: redo 27 with some changing numbers (lower nIters/different particles)

29: sqerr for above is broken. fix?

30: reweight! had r and h switched. Fixed now? Nope....

31: fixed params inheritance and forwardDistribution centering. Ran halfway, got impatient.

32: other half of 31, with fewer runs.

33: fixed tempering of model, so sqerr doesn't diverge. temper=0.5

34: Quick rerun out to 20 steps to see if temper=0.5 is stable

35: rerun with temper=0.5 (I think? see if it agrees with 34)

36: with temper=0.85 (??)

37: was in same file as 36, split off

38: as above, focusing on 800 particles (and tiny nonfinkels) with 20/70 nIters. 10 reps. 3,9 hpl

39: mhType/sampType loops in proper place inside; 400 particles 15 steps 4 reps 5,70 iters; 3,6 hpl. Note, part is running too fast compared to franken/finkel; should rebalance, not that it matters.

40: more of above, with more particles for vanilla particle filter, and more frequent file writes so I can stop "whenever".
(is there low-hanging fruit for optimizing franken?)

41: more of the same

42: width changed, from 25 to 50

43: ??

44: useForward=true, width 50 ... but failed to build params

45: junk

46: partial run width 25 useForward

47: A couple of runs like 46






graphone: (started after 47)

1: initial testing, two runs concatted but misformatted. 800 finkel.

2: down to 80 finkel.

3: first graphable

4: various trials

5: 80 finkel, just one params --- but divergent

6: non divergent

7: 100 dimensions
