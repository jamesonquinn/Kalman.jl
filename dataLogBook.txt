filtertest4.csv: using exp(-lp) INCONSISTENTLY in probSum, nIter = [1, 5, 20, 400]. No obvious trend in divergence over nIter; if anything, getting better.

filtertest5.csv: using exp(lp). Worse than filtertest4.

filtertest6.csv: using exp(-lp) consistently. Seems that it's right — the trace part of the divergence has a clear downward trend, yay. But — the diff-in-means part of the divergence has an upward trend. I think it's because I have not corrected for the forward density? I will try fixing that.


filtertest9.csv: bigger numbers of particles.

10: even more particles, but just for finkel.

11: like 10, ... forgot to make fps global. oh well.

12: global fps...
julia> print([cor(wmean,bkf.params(finalDist)[1]),
       cor(vec(mean(fps[end].tip.particles,2)),bkf.params(finalDist)[1]),
       cor(wmean,vec(mean(fps[end].tip.particles,2))),
       cor(wmean,observations[end].y),
       cor(observations[end].y,bkf.params(finalDist)[1])
       ])
[0.85266, 0.863401, 0.999003, 0.91942, 0.791686]

13: removing forwardProb correction. Better!

14: mega sim — but no timing. BROKEN! measures divegence from final step, not from current step.

15: mega sim 2. 2 histPerLoc.

16: vary histPerLoc. uniform history sampling

17: as above, with MhSampLog(7.5,20.0)

NOOOOO! 15-17 were as broken as 14. Fixed.

18: like 17 but works???

19: now with timing. But finkel fails — try/catch issue?

20: several abortive runs trying to fix try/catch.

21: fixed??

22: compromise?

23: more compromise, with lower histPerLoc (to make up for more locs)

24: mhcompromise with sampleuniform
